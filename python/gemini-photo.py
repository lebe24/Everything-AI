Avoid direct sunlight as it can scorch the leaves.\n* **Water:** Water when the top inch of soil is dry. Avoid overwatering. \n* **Humidity:** This plant likes humid environments. You can place it on a pebble tray with water or mist the leaves regularly.\n* **Temperature:** Keep it in temperatures above 60Â°F. \n* **Soil:** Use well-draining potting mix. \n* **Fertilizer:** Feed with diluted liquid fertilizer every few weeks during the growing season. \n\nIt's worth noting that this plant is typically a seasonal grower and may lose its vibrant purple foliage in winter. However, with the right care, it will come back again in the spring. \n",
